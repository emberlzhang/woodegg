These are more than just books. This is really <strong>an ongoing research project that will be repeating and improving every year</strong>.  This 2013 edition is the very start.
</p><p>
<strong>If you buy any of these books</strong>, you have full access to all of our research, and the ability to <a href="/contact">ask us any question</a>, and <strong>we will find the answer for you.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>If you have insights or information about any of these countries</strong>, things that were missing or wrong in this guide, <a href="/contact">email me anything</a>, and I’ll be happy to include it in the next edition, and give you credit.
</p><p>
<strong>If you want to get paid to improve next year’s guide</strong>, just <a href="/contact">email</a> to let me know.
</p>

<h2>How these books were made</h2>
<ol>
<li>I <strong>wrote 200 questions</strong> to be asked of each country.</li>
<li>I <strong>hired multiple researchers</strong> in each country to answer each question.  One local, one foreigner, one other.  I wanted the book to be <strong>more than one person’s point of view.</strong></li>
<li>I hired a writer/editor to turn the <strong>multiple different answers into one combined answer.</strong></li>
<li>I went through the final answer to proofread and improve.</li>
</ol>

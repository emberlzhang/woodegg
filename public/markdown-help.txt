MARKDOWN SYNTAX NEEDED (and not needed):

#    h1		Don't use. Only for section names. (Country, Culture, Life)
##   h2		Don't use. Only for sub-section names. (Local differences, Grants, Incorporating)
###  h3		Don't use. Only for question. ("How should a new business decide where to locate in Japan?")
#### h4		Use for sectioning inside a single long essay.

*   list
*   items
*   here

1.  numbered
2.  lists
3.  like this

Leave an empty line before lists begin.

For something to be **bold print, do double asterix**, like that.

But for something to be *italicized, do single asterix*, instead.

I think in e-books, the italicized style is more common than bold-printing.

For URLs, put a bracket around them, like this: <http://blahblah.net/whatever.html>

(Verify the link to make sure it works. And if it can do without www. or /index.html then please remove it, to make it easier for people who will manually type it in.  Remove trailing period if at end of sentence.)

Same thing with email addresses: <derek@sivers.org> 

That should be all we need.  Let me know if you run into something that needs different formatting.

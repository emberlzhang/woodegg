<p>
It’s time to create the 2014 Startup Guides to <strong>Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam</strong>.
</p><p>
Starting immediately and <strong>done by December 2013</strong>. If you have time this year to help, it’s an amazing learning experience.  Here’s what’s needed:
</p>

<h2>Researcher</h2>
<p>
<strong>You must be in one of those countries</strong>.  Boots on the ground.  Your mission is to <strong>ask some questions of the experts</strong>, in-person or on the phone.  The questions will be <a href="http://woodegg.com/cn#toc">from this list</a> (per-country). For example: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Find a few investors. Ask their thoughts on what that country is missing, what sectors need improvement, what are the biggest opportunities, and how businesses find investors.</li>
	<li>Find someone who has lived in that and another country. Ask about the differences and comparisons between the two cultures.</li>
	<li>Find a few people with their finger on the pulse of current events. Ask about the 2013 zeitgeist, and what changes seem likely in the next 5 years.</li>
	<li>Find a government official who works with small business or economic development. Ask about incentives, current developments, departments to know, and any advice.</li>
	<li>Find a few real estate people. Ask what’s the best place for a new business to locate.</li>
	<li>Find a few people good at describing the culture of the country to outsiders. Let them brain-dump as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This can be done in 2-3 weeks of full-time journalist-style research.  You get nice business cards, a @woodegg.com email address, and access to all of my contacts, with personal introductions.
</p>
<h3>This role is ideal for someone wanting to do business in that country, and using this guide as an excuse to make some great contacts, and learn as much as possible.</h3>

<h2>Writer</h2>
<p>
<strong>You will be the co-writer of the book</strong> (along with me), <strong>listed in the author credits on Amazon and everywhere</strong>.
</p><p>
It’s a challenge, but it’s rewarding.  You go through <a href="http://woodegg.com/cn#toc">these questions</a>, one at a time, in our online research area, and read the four or five different answers to the question.  Using those, you write a single essay-style answer to the question, combining the different viewpoints and information.
</p><p>
They say the best way to learn something is to teach it, so the most rewarding part of this is you’ll really be learning, understanding, then teaching what you’ve learned.  (Bonus points if you already have experience in this country.)
</p>
<h3>This role is ideal for someone who wants to learn more about a country, but wants to work at home, learning by reading and writing.</h3>

<h2>Editor</h2>
<p>
<strong>You read and improve the final essays before they’re published in the book.</strong>
</p><p>
One at a time, in our online research area, you’ll read the final essays by the writer, and make any improvements needed.
</p><p>
This is done in plain text, in the browser, using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> format.  You’ll see a live preview of exactly how it will look in the book.
</p>
<h3>This role is ideal for someone who is a perfectionist, and would have read the book anyway, but would like to get paid to do it, instead of pay to do it.</h3>

<h2>Manager</h2>
<p>
<strong>You organize everything described, above.</strong>
</p><p>
I’ve got a nice online system built to manage everything efficiently, but still someone has to do it.  It can be done from anywhere.
</p>
<h3>This role is ideal if you’d like to be president of Wood Egg some day.</h3>

<h1>How to Apply?</h1>
<p>
<strong>Just <a href="mailto:derek@sivers.org">email me at derek@sivers.org</a>.</strong>
</p><p>
Tell me what country and what role you'd like.  Make your best case for why you are the best person for the job.
</p><p>
This is <strong>short-term</strong>, to start immediately, and be <strong>done by December 2013</strong>.
</p><p>
Don't ask what it pays.  Tell me what you would need to get paid to do it.
</p><p>
<strong>Ideally, you've got your own self-interested reasons for wanting to become an expert in one or more of these countries.</strong>  And your primary goal is the knowledge, relationships, and experience from doing this.  Make sure to tell me about your reasons and goals, when you email me.
